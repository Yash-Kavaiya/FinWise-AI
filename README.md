## 🏗️ System Architecture

FinWise-AI employs a hierarchical multi-agent system with specialized sub-agents coordinated by a central financial coordinator:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│       Financial Coordinator Agent        │
│         (Orchestrator/Router)           │
└────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
             │
    ┌────────┴────────┬────────────┬─────────────┐
    ▼                 ▼            ▼             ▼
┌─────────┐    ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐ ┌──────────┐
│  Data   │    │   Trading   │ │ Execution   │ │   Risk   │
│ Analyst │    │   Analyst   │ │  Analyst    │ │ Analyst  │
└─────────┘    └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘ └──────────┘
```
